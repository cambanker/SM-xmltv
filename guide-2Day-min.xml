    <desc lang="en">Sticky buns are a bakery staple, made from yeast dough and baked with sweet, sticky ingredients. Starting with Classic Cinnamon Sticky Buns, Anna shares her trade secrets on baking the perfect bun. She then advances the lesson with a British-style Chelsea Loaf, filled with both dried and candied fruit. Anna next makes her favourite version of sticky buns: Banana Walnut Sticky Buns with delicious white chocolate frosting. This is a dessert style sticky bun more than a breakfast treat, and it is sure to impress. And with any day-old leftovers—hard to imagine—Anna creates Sticky Bun French Toast. Made with a cream cheese base and chocolate chips, this French toast is out of this world(n)</desc>

Freelance BBC radio producer Danny Wallace takes three simple words uttered by a stranger on a bus-"say yes more"-as a challenge and says "yes" to everything for a year. He says "yes" to pamphleteers on the street, the credit card offers stuffing his mailbox and solicitations on the Internet. He attends meetings with a group that believes aliens built the pyramids in Egypt, says "yes" to every invitation to go out on the town and furthers his career by saying "yes" in meetings with executives. And, yes, he does win $48,000, meet the world's only hypnotic do, earn a nursing degree and travel the globe. It may be stranger than fiction, but every hilarious moment is true!(n)</desc>

Starting with Classic Cinnamon Sticky Buns, Anna shares her trade secrets on baking the perfect bun. She then advances the lesson with a British-style Chelsea Loaf, filled with both dried and candied fruit. Anna next makes her favourite version of sticky buns: Banana Walnut Sticky Buns with delicious white chocolate frosting. This is a dessert style sticky bun more than a breakfast treat, and it is sure to impress. And with any day-old leftovers—hard to imagine—Anna creates Sticky Bun French Toast.

    <desc lang="en">Medieval fantasy meets futuristic science fiction in this effects-heavy action epic from former X-Files director Rob Bowman. In present-day London, 12-year-old Quinn Abercromby witnesses the awakening of a hibernating dragon from a centuries-long slumber, the result of a construction dig supervised by his mother and an incident for which Quinn feels partially responsible. Twenty years later, the adult Quinn is the fire chief of a refortified castle community, responsible for dousing the blazes lit by the dragon's prodigious number of flame-spewing offspring, airborne juggernauts that have wreaked havoc across the globe, torching civilization and turning humans into an endangered species. Hope arrives in the form of Denton "Dragon Slayer" Van Zan, an American known to be the only man to ever kill one of the dragons, and Alex Jenson, a scientist/pilot who's a member of Van Zan's army, a zealous fighting force that includes a secret weapon: the Archangels, paratroopers using themselves as bait to attract and then dispatch the deadly beasts(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Social Network (2010)</title>
    <desc lang="en">Jesse Eisenberg stars in this highly acclaimed and Oscar-winning fictionalised telling of the tetchy story behind Facebook's birth. Directed by David Fincher, it was inspired by Ben Mezrich's book the Accidental Billionaires and written by Aaron Sorkin, the sharp wordsmith of television's The West Wing. 'You don't get to 500 million friends without making a few enemies' stated the movie's poster, and so it's appropriate that this gripping drama kicks off with neurotic Harvard computer science student Mark Zuckerberg drunkenly creating a misogynistic website called Facemash in revenge for being dumped by his girlfriend Erica. Once the hangover has worn off, Zuckerberg realises he may have the germ of a nifty idea, as long as he shifts the focus from settling scores to social interaction. Events unfold partly through chronological flashback and partly via later courtroom testimony, as the tale of friendships and business partnerships made and broken is told from the viewpoints of those involved. Sorkin's smart, humorous script propels the film with a kinetic energy throughout. And he and Fincher won Oscars, Baftas and a host of other awards for their movie(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis star in Seth MacFarlane's irreverent and vulgar comedy-drama about the relationship between a man, a woman and the man's toy bear. The young John Bennett had such an unpleasant and lonely childhood that he wished his soft toy, Teddy, would come alive and be his friend. And to everyone's surprise it did. The walking, talking and wisecracking plush creature became an overnight sensation - even appearing on The Johnny Carson Show. But fame being what it is, Teddy's time in the limelight ended. Now, Bennett is a directionless slacker in his 30s and still inseparable from Ted. They share a fondness for booze and pot, but the cynical bear has also developed his own distinctive sexual peccadillos, which he indulges with prostitutes (while harbouring a deep resentment that he wasn't made with anatomical correctness). However, Bennett's emotional loyalty towards Ted faces its biggest test yet, in the shape of Bennett's girlfriend Lori. She feels Bennett needs to grow up - and choose between her and Ted. Meanwhile, the bear must deal with a fan who's stalking him(n)</desc>

The characters and stories slightly co-incide but Tarantino's assurance carries the film, with the script, action and black humour absolutely spot on. While some block-busters court product placement, Tarantino prefers his own mythical brands, including Red Apple cigarettes, smoked by Bruce Willis in Pulp Fiction and Tim Roth in Four Rooms (also showing on FilmFour this month)(n)</desc>

However, despite their proximity to the ocean, they prove themselves time and again truly fish out of water as they hopelessly attempt to cover for the city's regular police force, who are languishing in bio-quarantine following the attack. The plot consists of a string of loosely linked skits, while the humour is firmly at the bawdy, definitely non-PC, end of the scale.

The mutants are gathered into two camps. Those at Professor Charles Xavier's (Patrick Stewart) school are taught to curb their powers and use them for good, while his opposite number, Magneto (Ian McKellen), believes that humans want to destroy them and is assembling a force to win the day by turning the world's leaders into mutants. The film concentrates on Wolverine and Rogue (Hugh Jackman, Anna Paquin), who side with Xavier as the two factions launch into climactic battle. Edited for language and violence ; HD Wide(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Titanic (1997)</title>
    <desc lang="en">James Cameron's Oscar-laden epic tells of the first and final voyage of the 'unsinkable' luxury liner through the love story of two very different passengers. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Jack Dawson, a brash chancer in the steerage part of the ship who talks his way up to the staterooms and fancy restaurants where he meets Rose DeWitt Bukater. She is promised to Cal Hockley in a loveless match but falls for Jack. The first half of the film establishes their story, the second the fate of the Titanic once it has struck the iceberg. The destinies of all the crew and passengers is mirrored by the tragedy that befalls the two lovers, while spectacular special effects recreate the ship's fate.
